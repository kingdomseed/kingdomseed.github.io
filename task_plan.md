# Task Plan: Professional website content update (truthful, non-embellished)

## Goal
Produce a fair, balanced, professional content update plan (and, if approved later, the actual edits) for this website that clearly communicates who Jason Holt is professionally, grounded in verifiable facts and avoiding embellishment.

## Current Phase
Phase 3

## Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
- [x] Read `docs/professional_inventory_update.md` and extract candidate claims
- [x] Review current website copy (`index.html`) and identify deltas/gaps
- [x] Identify constraints: tone, target roles, privacy/NDAs, evidence standards
- [x] Document findings in `findings.md`
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 2: Content Strategy & Structure
- [x] Define target positioning (primary + secondary role titles)
- [x] Choose page structure changes (headline, summary, skills, work highlights)
- [x] Define “evidence rules” (how we phrase claims without proof)
- [x] Decide what to omit or soften (risk of overstatement)
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 3: Draft Copy (Truth-Checked)
- [ ] Draft updated headline + professional summary
- [ ] Draft “What I do / How I work / What I’ve shipped” sections
- [ ] Convert inventory items into concise, public-safe bullets
- [ ] Add optional “proof points” (links, projects, measurable outcomes) where available
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 4: Integrate Into Site + QA
- [ ] Map drafted copy to `index.html` sections (minimal structural changes)
- [ ] Verify consistency with resume/LinkedIn/public artifacts (no new claims)
- [ ] Check for unsupported superlatives (“expert”, “world-class”, etc.)
- [ ] Run a final “truth + tone” review checklist
- **Status:** in_progress

### Phase 5: Delivery
- [ ] Present an edit list (what to change, where, and why)
- [ ] Provide final copy blocks ready to paste
- [ ] Call out any remaining open questions for you to decide
- **Status:** pending

## Key Questions
1. What exact role title(s) should the homepage optimize for (e.g., “Senior Software Engineer”, “Staff Engineer”, “Engineering Manager”, “Product Engineer”)?
2. Who is the primary audience for the site (recruiters, hiring managers, founders, peers, clients)?
3. Are there any employers/clients/projects that must not be mentioned publicly (NDA/privacy)?
4. Do you want outcomes framed as metrics only when you can substantiate them, or are qualitative outcomes acceptable if phrased cautiously?
5. Should the voice be first-person (“I build…”) or third-person (“Jason builds…”)?

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| “Evidence-first” phrasing | Prevents accidental embellishment; keeps claims defensible. |
| Prefer specific scope over big adjectives | “Built X on Y” reads stronger and more truthful than “expert”. |
| Preserve existing site structure unless needed | Minimizes scope creep and keeps update focused on content. |
| Treat analytics metrics as “opt-in” | MAU/retention claims are strong but need definitions + your comfort publishing them. |

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
