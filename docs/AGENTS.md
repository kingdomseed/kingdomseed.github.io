# AGENTS.md

## Scope
Applies to `docs/` and its subfolders.

## Rules
- Write only what is true and supportable from repo context.
- Use concrete dates and definitions when describing timelines or metrics.
- If something is uncertain or private, omit it or label it clearly as an assumption.
- Keep edits surgical; avoid rewriting whole docs unless asked.
