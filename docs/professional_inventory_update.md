### Potential Website Content Updates
Website Update Recommendations for kingdomseed.github.io

This document outlines suggested updates to your kingdomseed.github.io resume site. Each section from the current site is listed along with specific recommendations to ensure the content reflects your verified achievements and current professional direction. The aim is to maintain accuracy, emphasise verified metrics, and focus on your strengths as a product‑centric developer and educator.

Hero Section

Change the headline: Replace the current headline “Front End Developer & Learning Product Specialist” with a title that better captures your role, such as “Cross‑Platform Product Developer & Learning Specialist.” This highlights your work in building official Mythic GME apps with Flutter and your background in learning products.

Update the subtext: Mention that you build and maintain official Mythic Game Master Emulator apps under licence from Word Mill Games and have scaled the active user base from 350 monthly users in March 2025 to about 1,600 in 2026. Also note that your apps maintain an average rating around 4.8/5 across Android and iOS stores.

Revise call‑to‑action buttons: Instead of generic “Hire Me,” include options like “Explore My Products,” “Join the Beta Community,” or “Discuss Product Collaboration.” These calls reflect your focus on product development and community engagement.

Metrics (Stats) Section

Update growth metrics: Replace the “400 % user growth (200 → ~1 000)” statistic with current data (e.g., 350 → 1 600 monthly active users). Since you can verify these numbers via PostHog, provide a brief footnote or tooltip clarifying that the metrics come from your analytics.

Clarify retention figures: Keep the “85 % retention” statistic but add a brief note on how retention is calculated and over which period it is measured. Explicitly state that this retention rate is based on active monthly users.

Consolidate “11 years of learning product experience”: This line conflates your nine years of teaching with recent app development. Rephrase to “9 years teaching computer science and digital design, plus 2 years of product development” to be transparent about how the total experience is derived.

Frameworks / Skills Section

Prioritise relevant technologies: Re‑order or group the icons to emphasise Flutter & Dart (your primary development stack) and Python/NLP tools (reflecting your Master’s studies). Secondary technologies such as Next.js, React, and TypeScript can still appear but should not dominate if they are not currently central to your work.

Add product and AI tools: Include icons or labels for PostHog (analytics), Figma (design), Miro, and any LLM tools you regularly use, reinforcing your product management and AI integration capabilities.

Remove unused or minor tools: If you no longer actively work with frameworks like Shopify/e‑commerce platforms, eliminate them to avoid confusion.

Experience Timeline

Current role: For the “CTO, Front End Lead & Learning Product Specialist” entry, rename it to “Founder & Lead Product Developer at Jason Holt Digital”. Update the timeframe to “2024–present.” Adjust bullet points to:

Reflect scaling the MAU from 350 to 1 600 and maintaining 85 % retention.

Note shipping Mythic GME Mobile and Mythic GME Digital, with an average rating of ~4.8/5.

Mention building jasonholtphotography.com with custom gallery logic and booking API.

If you have indeed built an AI chat platform with multiple LLM integrations, clarify its purpose and current status. Otherwise, consider moving this item to a separate project description or omitting it if it overstates your active work.

Teaching roles: Merge similar teaching positions to highlight key achievements: high exam pass rates, creation of an MYP web‑design curriculum, mentorship of yearbook and tech clubs, and growth of computer‑science enrollment. Emphasise how these experiences developed your instructional design and leadership skills.

Remove irrelevant descriptors: Eliminate references to “Shopify and eCommerce projects” or other template copy that does not apply to your actual work. Instead, emphasise product strategy, curriculum development, and cross‑platform application design.

Portfolio Section

Update project summaries: For the Mythic GME Mobile card, state that the app is an official adaptation of Mythic 2nd Edition and that you have delivered regular updates since 2024, adding premium content, custom layouts, and new UX features. Include the 4.8/5 average rating and note the growth in MAU to 1 600.

Add Mythic GME Digital: If not already present, create a separate portfolio card for the desktop version (Mythic GME Digital) to showcase your cross‑platform capability. Note that it provides the same features in a desktop environment, improving accessibility for users who prefer larger screens or keyboard input.

Revise the “Digital Product Site” card: Highlight that JasonHoltDigital.com is built with Astro and serves as the official platform for your products, release notes, and community updates. Emphasise the value of transparent changelogs and user‑driven development.

Clarify AI projects: If you retain the AI chat platform project in the portfolio, provide more context on its scope—e.g., “Prototype AI chat tool for internal research leveraging multiple LLMs and vector search.” Remove it if it’s not currently under active development.

Education & Credentials

Highlight current studies: Ensure the card for University of Stuttgart – M.Sc. Computational Linguistics clearly states “In progress” with an expected completion year (e.g., 2027). Include a short description linking your coursework to future product enhancements (e.g., integrating natural language processing into your apps).

Group additional certifications: List your B.A. in Linguistics and French, Android Development Nanodegree, UX Design program, AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, PSM I, and other credentials. To improve readability, consider summarising the certifications into categories (e.g., Development, Design, Cloud & Infrastructure) and linking to external proof if possible.

Skills & Tools Matrix

Reorganise by competency: Present your skills in clusters—Cross‑Platform Development (Flutter/Dart, Kotlin/Swift), Backend & Infrastructure (Firebase, AWS), AI & NLP (Python, Hugging Face, vector search), Product & Design (Figma, Miro, PostHog), and Web Tools (Astro, Next.js, React). This helps visitors quickly see where your strengths lie.

Update AI tools: If you actively use LLMs like GPT‑4, Claude, or Gemini, list them along with brief notes on your experience (e.g., “LLM integration for dynamic storytelling in Mythic apps”).

Call‑To‑Action & Footer

Refine the call‑to‑action: Invite visitors to download the apps, join your Discord community, or discuss potential collaborations rather than simply “hire me.” This better reflects your focus on product growth and community engagement.

Provide transparent contact options: Include links to your LinkedIn, GitHub, and a business email address. A short note that you respond personally to feedback will reinforce trust.

General Tone and Content

Be transparent about numbers: Since you can verify user growth and retention through PostHog, present these numbers confidently and clarify their timeframe. Avoid ambiguous claims or marketing buzzwords.

Emphasise the synergy of teaching and product development: Throughout the site, weave in how your teaching background informs your ability to create intuitive, learner‑oriented products and lead cross‑functional teams.

Use clear, concise language: Remove template‑sounding phrases and ensure that each statement accurately reflects your work. Readers should immediately understand what you have built, how it has been received, and what you are currently pursuing.

Current Roles and Projects

Founder & Lead Developer – Jason Holt Digital (Aug 2024 – present)
Jason founded Jason Holt Digital, under a licensed partnership with Word Mill Games to build the official Mythic Game Master Emulator (2e) companion apps. He develops and maintains two products:

Mythic GME Mobile (iOS/Android) – A solo role‑playing companion app designed for GM‑less play. It implements the Mythic 2nd‑edition “Fate Chart” and “Fate Check”, supports scene management and adventure logs with Markdown and spell‑check, provides customizable dice rollers, and allows users to create/import custom tables. The app prioritizes accessibility with screen‑reader support, adjustable typography and color‑blind friendly palettes.

On Apple’s App Store, Mythic GME Mobile is rated 4.7/5 (34 ratings) and highlights features like Prepared Adventure mode, customizable panel layouts on iPad and iCloud sync.

On Google Play, the companion app (marketed as Mythic GME 2e) holds a 4.9/5 rating with 92 reviews and more than 1 thousand downloads. Recent updates (v1.5.8, released 7 Jan 2026) added 60+ new premium tables, simplified Fate Chart displays, a customizable panel layout and an undo feature. The update improved privacy explanations and reorganized settings.

Mythic GME Digital (Windows/macOS/Linux) – A desktop companion that mirrors mobile features and adds customizable panel layouts and an in‑app help center. It is distributed DRM‑free via itch.io and the Microsoft Store.

Jason builds these apps using Flutter to ensure cross‑platform parity and manages community‑driven development. The feature roadmap is openly discussed via Discord and a feature‑request board, and user feedback drives over half of the improvements.

Nine‑Year Career in Education – Prior to moving into app development, Jason taught computer science and digital design for nine years. He led high‑school computer‑science programs, coached teams, and explained complex technical systems in accessible ways. During this period he also served as a technology specialist and department chair (information from his previous CV); these experiences now inform his emphasis on accessibility and community feedback.

Two‑Year Leadership & Service Practicum – Jason completed a two‑year practicum focused on leadership, mentorship and service, developing skills in organization and community engagement. These experiences contribute to his collaborative development style and user‑centric approach.

Skills and Focus

Cross‑Platform App Development – Primary stack: Flutter/Dart for mobile and desktop apps. Familiar with JSON/Markdown for data interoperability and accessible UI design.

Natural‑Language Processing & Computational Linguistics – Currently studying NLP methods such as text classification, speech recognition and language modeling in the M.Sc. program. Integrating NLP into mobile applications to enhance solo RPG experiences is a central research interest.

Education & Communication – Experienced educator capable of explaining complex technical concepts simply and designing learning experiences for diverse audiences.

Community‑Driven Development – Uses Discord and public feature request boards to gather feedback; over 60% of app improvements come directly from community suggestions.

Adjustments to Previous Professional Inventory

Front‑End Emphasis: An older site (BinaryLoom.io) portrays Jason primarily as a Front‑End Lead with skills in Next.js and React. This emphasis oversells his web‑development focus; his current direction is Flutter‑based cross‑platform app development and computational linguistics. The updated inventory downplays web‑framework claims and instead highlights Flutter/Dart, app design and NLP.

Metrics & Achievements: Claims about “400 % user‑base growth,” “4.8/5 stars” and “85 % retention” on older portfolio sites cannot be independently verified and are therefore omitted. Instead, verifiable metrics from official app stores are cited: 4.7/5 rating (Apple), 4.9/5 rating and 1K+ downloads (Google Play).

Updated Education: Added the ongoing M.Sc. in Computational Linguistics at the University of Stuttgart with start date (October 2025) and program details.

Research Direction: Emphasized the integration of mobile apps and NLP as Jason’s current research focus, aligning the professional inventory with his academic pursuits.

This updated professional inventory draws from verifiable sources to reflect Jason’s present education, roles, projects and skills without embellishment. It highlights the shift toward cross‑platform app development and computational linguistics while preserving his teaching background and community‑centric approach.
