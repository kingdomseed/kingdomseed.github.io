Prompt:
Act as a world -class Creative Technologist and Senior Frontend Engineer from the year
2099. Build a hyper -realistic, retro-futuristic "MCP -2099" developer platform interface
using React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, GSAP, and React Three Fiber (Three.js).
The design must be Awwwards custom WebGL shaders.
-level: cinematic, grid -based, and heavily reliant on
Core Aesthetic & Vibe:
• Style: High -fidelity Retro-Futurism / Cyberpunk (Year 2099).
• Visual Language: Clean, grid -based layouts, holographic UI elements,
glassmorphism, and cinematic typography.
• Color Palette:
o Dark Mode: Deep Cyber -Black ( #050505 ), Neon Orange ( #ff4d00 ), Neon
Blue (#00f3ff).
o Light Mode: stark Gray/White technical look with darker blue accents.
• Typography: Inter for UI/Body, JetBrains Mono for data/code.
Technical Stack & Libraries
• Framework: React 19 (TypeScript).
• Styling: Tailwind CSS (Grid patterns, utility classes, dark mode).
• 3D Engine: Three.js + React Three Fiber (WebGL).
• Animation: GSAP (UI motion), Custom GLSL Shaders (3D effects).
• Icons: Lucide React.
Key Features & Components
1. Cinematic Loader
• Visuals: A full-screen WebGL overlay featuring a rotating holographic ring with
data artifacts and a "Digital Void" background.
• Shaders: Custom fragment shaders for the ring (pulsing, scanlines) and
background (subtle radial ripples).
• Behavior: Simulates a kernel initialization with scrambled text decoding (e.g.,
"LOADING_ASSETS" → "SYSTEM_READY") and a smooth fade -out transition.
2. Hero Section
• Background: A procedural 3D Data Globe.
o Vertex Shader: "Breathing" displacement using sine waves.
o Fragment Shader: Glowing particles with scanline interference passing
through the globe.
o Parallax: depth.
Background starfield moves at a different speed to create
• UI: Massive, tracking -tight typography ("Engineering, Supercharged") with
localized blurs and gradient text.
3. Navigation System
• Design: Floating glassmorphic top bar.
• Interactions: Hover effects trigger terminal -style cursors ( > Interface ).
• Functionality:
o Client-side routing (Interface, Neural Net, Protocol, Logs, Dashboard).
o Global Theme Toggle (Sun/Moon) that instantly repaints 3D scenes and
UI.
o "Initialize" CTA that launches the Dashboard.
4. "Sentient Core" (Neural Net Page)
• Centerpiece: An interactive, pulsing AI Brain.
o Complex Shaders: Uses 3D Simplex Noise for organic vertex
displacement and a "branching vein" fragment shader to simulate data
flow and neural firing.
• Particle Cloud: 400 orbiting nodes around the core.
o Physics: Custom collision detection and repulsion logic (particles push
away from each other to avoid clumping).
o Interaction: Particles light up (Neon burst) when hovered and slowly fade
back to base color.
5. Mission Control Dashboard
• Layout: Bento -grid style high -density data interface.
• Widgets:
o Global Node Map: Stylized dot -matrix map with floating tooltips.
o Metrics: CPU/Memory SVG bars, Network Traffic area charts.
o Security: Live threat counters and status indicators.
• Animation: GSAP stagger effects on load.
6. System Logs & Protocol
• Logs: A live-updating terminal feed simulating server events
([INFO], [WARN], [SEC] ) with auto-scrolling.
• Protocol: A documentation page featuring "Encryption Layer" and "Smart
Contract" specs with neon -accented cards.
