# Hierarchy Audit (What should be primary/secondary/tertiary)

This is a “hiring manager skim” view: what should jump out in 10 seconds, 60 seconds, and 5 minutes.

## Primary (10 seconds)
1. **Positioning**: Product Engineer building cross-platform products with Flutter/Dart.
2. **Proof**: tangible shipped work (Mythic app(s) / cross-platform shipping) + one grounded metric (Avg MAU ≈ 1,600, Oct–Dec 2025).
3. **Trajectory**: M.Sc. Computational Linguistics (why you’re moving deeper into ML/DL/NLP).
4. **CTA**: Contact + download CV (always visible in nav).

## Secondary (60 seconds)
1. **Case studies** (short but credible):
   - LibreChat on Azure (ops + RAG experimentation discipline).
   - Photography site on Azure Container Apps (deployment + CI/CD + product polish).
2. **Experience narrative**:
   - “Independent developer shipping products end-to-end” (current).
   - “9 years teaching CS/digital design” (communication + leadership + UX instincts).
3. **Skills grouped by competency (not by buzz)**:
   - Flutter/Dart (primary)
   - ML/NLP (Python/PyTorch, plus what you’re actively using/studying)
   - Cloud/Infra (Azure, Docker, CI/CD)
   - Product/Design (Figma, research, accessibility)
   - Web tooling (Astro/Next/React) last (still present, but visually de-emphasized)

## Tertiary (5 minutes)
1. **Certifications + professional development** (curated list on homepage; full list in CV).
2. **Awards & recognition** (kept, but scoped: education/innovation credibility, not “sales”).
3. **Open source / community** (only if accurate and specific; otherwise keep minimal).

## Proposed homepage flow (story + resume in one)
1. Hero: name + positioning + 2-sentence summary + CTAs.
2. Proof strip: 2–3 metrics + “shipped across 5 platforms”.
3. Featured product: Mythic app(s) (1–2 cards) + “what it does / why it matters”.
4. Case studies: 2 cards (LibreChat, Photography).
5. Experience: concise timeline (expandable details optional).
6. Skills: competency clusters (Flutter first, web last).
7. Education + key certs + awards (curated).
8. Contact / connect: email + LinkedIn + GitHub + location; reiterate availability.

## Notes on current mis-emphasis (to fix)
- Hero headline reads like a generic product motto; make the `Product Engineer — Flutter/Dart — CompLing` line the visual anchor.
- “Frontend Frameworks” should not lead with Next.js/React; Flutter should be the first cluster and the first items within clusters.
- Portfolio should not lead with web; lead with the Flutter product(s) and then case studies.
