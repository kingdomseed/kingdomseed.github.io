- Role: Product Engineer.
- Primary stack: Flutter + Dart (cross-platform: mobile + desktop).
- Academic focus: M.Sc. Computational Linguistics (ML/DL/NLP focus).
- Based in: Frankfurt, Germany.
- Work interest: Open to full-time, contract, part-time, and internships.

## Products (primary proof)
- Shipped a cross-platform product across 5 platforms: iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux.

## Case studies (secondary proof, but important)
- Private LLM chat workspace (LibreChat) deployed and operated on Azure (VM + Docker Compose) for coursework + document workflows + RAG experimentation.
- Photography portfolio/booking site built with Next.js and deployed as a container to Azure Container Apps (ACR + CI/CD), with “AI-assisted iteration” described as a process (guardrails, verification), not hype.

### Verified from local repos/config
- Photography repo confirms: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, GitHub Actions, Azure Container Apps (containerized via Docker + ACR).
- LibreChat config confirms currently configured Azure AI Foundry models (no Claude currently configured).

## Education & credentials (supporting)
- University of Stuttgart: started Oct 2025, expected graduation Summer 2027 (M.Sc. Computational Linguistics).
- UT Arlington: B.A. Linguistics (Cum Laude) and B.A. French (2012).

## Awards & recognition (keep; credibility boosters)
- Top Hat Award for Inspiring Innovation (Oct 2023).
- Core Value of the Month Winner (3×, 2021–2024).

## Claims that require confirmation/source before use
- “Official” / “licensed” phrasing around the Mythic app(s): confirm exact wording you want publicly.
- Any app store ratings, download counts, retention %, revenue, or “X% growth” claims: include only if you have a source you’re comfortable linking/citing (or omit).
- “200+ beta testers” (and any analytics tooling used): confirm the number + whether/how you want to mention tracking (Firebase/PostHog/etc.).
- Open-source contribution claims (e.g., Shorebird / `icloud_storage_plus`): confirm accuracy and preferred specificity (generic vs link to PRs).
