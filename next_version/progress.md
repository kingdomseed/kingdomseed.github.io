# Progress Log

## Session: 2026-01-16

### Current Status
- **Phase:** 1 - Requirements & Discovery
- **Started:** 2026-01-16

### Actions Taken
- Initialized `next_version/` planning files (`task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`).
- Reviewed current homepage hero + examined repo variants (`flutter/index.html`, `frontend/index.html`).
- Captured initial findings and constraints in `next_version/findings.md`.
- Drafted planning artifacts for next iteration:
  - `next_version/truth_set.md`
  - `next_version/content_inventory.md`
  - `next_version/hierarchy_audit.md`
  - `next_version/questions_and_decisions.md`
- Drafted initial copy blocks in `next_version/copy_deck.md`.
- Wrote decision brief in `next_version/tech_options.md`.
- Wrote detailed copy review in `next_version/copy_audit_detailed.md`.
- Proposed homepage IA in `next_version/story_structure.md`.
- Proposed palette directions in `next_version/color_directions.md`.
- Pivoted direction to A3 (React/Next.js) per user; updated `next_version/task_plan.md` and truth/copy docs accordingly.
- Locked the framework choice to **Vite + React + Supabase edge functions** (no Next.js) and created a spec navigation map in `next_version/spec_map.md`.
- Updated plan to place the app root at `next_version/jh-resume/` and to require theme switching (default spec palette + C1/C2/C3 toggles).
