# Questions + Decisions (to make this easy)

These are the decisions we need from you. I’m only asking where it’s either taste-based or requires your confirmation for truth/comfort.

## A) Direction (lock early)
1. **Build approach (pick one)**
   - **A1 — Keep static HTML/CSS/JS (recommended for speed):** we reorganize into `next_version/` with chunked CSS and “section blocks” you can reorder by moving HTML blocks.
   - **A2 — Migrate to Astro:** more composable sections/components and easier reuse for case studies, but adds a build pipeline + project structure.
   - **A3 — React/Next.js:** most complex; only worth it if you want richer app-like interactions.

2. **Homepage emphasis (confirm)**
   - Primary: **Flutter/Dart + Product Engineering**  
   - Secondary: **CompLing (ML/DL/NLP) + Azure/DevOps**  
   - Tertiary: **Web/Next.js/Astro**  
   Confirm this exact ordering is what you want.

3. **Social proof links (taste + strategy)**
   - Keep LinkedIn link prominent
   - Keep LinkedIn link but de-emphasize (footer only)
   - Remove LinkedIn entirely (GitHub + email only)
   Your `next_version/WHY_REACT.md` argues LinkedIn is “dead”; I’ll follow your preference here.

## B) Story (what visitors should feel/learn)
4. **Pick the “one sentence” identity statement** (this becomes the hero `H1`)
   - B1: “Product Engineer building Flutter/Dart cross-platform apps.”
   - B2: “Product Engineer shipping Flutter/Dart products, studying Computational Linguistics.”
   - B3: “Product Engineer (Flutter/Dart) with an M.Sc. focus in Computational Linguistics (NLP).”
   - (Or your own; we can iterate.)

5. **What’s the #1 proof you want to lead with on the homepage?**
   - P1: “Shipped across 5 platforms” (strong, factual).
   - P2: “Avg MAU ≈ 1,600 (Oct–Dec 2025)” (strong, but implies analytics credibility).
   - P3: “Official Mythic companion app(s)” (strongest if you’re comfortable with wording).

6. **Portfolio structure**
   - Should we split into **Products** (Mythic) vs **Case Studies** (LibreChat, Photography)?
   - Or keep one “Featured work” grid but reorder + tag?

## C) Truth / comfort checks (you decide wording)
7. **“Official/licensed” wording for Mythic**
   - What exact public phrasing are you comfortable with? (We’ll use your wording verbatim.)

8. **What can we cite publicly (if anything)?**
   - App store links? Analytics screenshots? None (keep claims unlinked/approx)?  
   Your preference determines how specific we can be with numbers/ratings.

## D) Design (taste-based; pick a lane)
9. **Theme**
   - D1: Dark-first (like `flutter/index.html`) with subtle light surfaces.
   - D2: Light-first with dark mode toggle.
   - D3: Dark-only (simplest).

10. **Color palette (emerald-leaning; pick one “direction”, not exact hex yet)**
   - C1: **Charcoal + Soft Bone + Emerald** (premium, calm, technical).
   - C2: **Deep Pine + Warm Gray + Electric Lime** (closer to the Flutter variant, more “energy”).
   - C3: **Ink Navy + Mist + Emerald** (trust/professional, less “neon”).

11. **Material 3 influence (subtle)**
   - Do you want the site to *feel* Material-ish mainly via **typography + spacing + state layers**, or do you also want **chips/cards** to look recognizably Material?

## E) Content curation (reduce overwhelm)
12. **Certifications on homepage**
   - Pick a cap: **6**, **10**, or **“top 3 only”**.

13. **Education + teaching**
   - Do we lead with “9 years teaching” as proof of communication/leadership, or keep it more background and lead with product shipping?

14. **Radar chart**
   - Keep a chart (but rework axes to Flutter/NLP/Cloud/Product with no “self-scored numbers”), or remove entirely?
   This matters because “UI Engineering: 95” can read like hype.

15. **Learning design vs education context**
   - You previously said learning design is separate from Flutter/Dart. Do you want to keep “Educational UX” as a *supporting* strength (communication/accessibility), but avoid “Instructional Design” language and detailed pedagogy terms on the homepage?
