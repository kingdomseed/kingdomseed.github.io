# Copy Deck (Next Version)

This is the working set of copy blocks we can paste into the next homepage and case-study pages. Everything here should stay within `next_version/truth_set.md`.

## Hero

### H1 options (pick one)
1. Product Engineer building Flutter/Dart cross-platform apps.
2. Product Engineer shipping Flutter/Dart products.
3. Product Engineer & Learning Design with an M.Sc. focus in Computational Linguistics (NLP). Maybe this can be improved--further (NLP can move to 2-sentence summary). I don't want to emphasize Flutter/Dart first--I want to emphasize end to end product development experience--every step i had to learn and take care of and then mention Flutter. Consider a reward for this.

### 2-sentence summary (draft)
I build and ship cross-platform products with Flutter/Dart. I’m completing an M.Sc. in Computational Linguistics (Oct 2025 → Summer 2027), with a focus on NLP and applied ML.

### One-paragraph framing (draft)
I’ve shipped products end-to-end as an independent developer since 2024. Before that, I spent 9 years in education—teaching computer science and leading technology initiatives—which shaped how I communicate, design, and build for real users.
