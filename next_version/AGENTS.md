# AGENTS.md

## Scope
Applies to `next_version/` except where overridden by deeper `AGENTS.md`.

## Rules
- Keep docs and implementation aligned. If you change behavior or copy in the app, update the relevant docs here in the same change.
- Don’t introduce parallel systems. Always ask: **How does this fit into the current architecture?**
- Preserve the “honest” behavior: direct, non-sycophantic, willing to say “not a fit”.
