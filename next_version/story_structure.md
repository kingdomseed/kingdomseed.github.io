# Story-First Structure (Homepage IA)

Objective: a hiring manager can skim and understand you quickly, while deeper readers can explore proof (products + case studies) without getting lost.

## Proposed homepage sections (in order)
1. **Hero**
   - H1: Product Engineer + Flutter/Dart (and optionally CompLing in the same line)
   - 2-sentence summary + CTAs (Download CV, Contact, View Work)
2. **Proof strip**
   - Avg MAU (Oct–Dec 2025) ≈ 1,600
   - Shipped across 5 platforms
   - 9 years teaching CS/digital design
3. **Products (Flutter-first)**
   - 1–2 cards for the Mythic product(s)
   - Short “what it is” + “what you owned”
4. **Case studies**
   - LibreChat (Azure) + Photography (Next.js + Azure)
   - Each framed as “what problem / what I did / what I learned”
5. **Experience (condensed)**
   - 3–5 roles max on homepage
   - Expandable details optional; keep default view short
6. **Skills (competency clusters)**
   - Flutter/Dart first; ML/NLP next; cloud next; design next; web last
   - Avoid “self-scored” charts unless clearly labeled as qualitative
7. **Education + key credentials**
   - Stuttgart + UTA
   - Curated certs (cap list)
8. **Awards (curated)**
   - 3–5 items, tied to credibility (innovation + learning)
9. **Connect**
   - Clear availability line + location + links

## What should move off the homepage (link instead)
- Full certification list (keep in CV or a dedicated “Credentials” page)
- Deep technical details of case studies (keep on case study pages)
- Any brand/legal pages for BinaryLoom Chat (keep out of nav and consider moving off the personal domain mirror)

## How we de-emphasize web without deleting proof
- Keep Next.js/Astro/React present, but place them:
  - Later in the skills list
  - As case studies (deployment/story) rather than “primary identity”
  - With subdued visual treatment (secondary chips/labels)

## Design notes (to align with your constraints)
- Use layout hierarchy (60/40), not lots of equal cards.
- Keep copy dense but skimmable: short paragraphs, strong headings, bullets where appropriate.
