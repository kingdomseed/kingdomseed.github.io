# Progress Log — Professional Website Update

## Session: 2026-01-15

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
- **Status:** complete
- **Started:** 2026-01-15 11:26:48 CET
- Actions taken:
  - Created planning files (`task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`).
  - Reviewed initial sections of `docs/professional_inventory_update.md` and current site copy in `index.html`.
  - Captured preliminary claim inventory + guardrails in `findings.md`.
  - Searched `index.html` and `docs/professional_inventory_update.md` for key sections (hero, metrics, experience, portfolio) to locate where claims live.
  - Captured the current site’s explicit metric claims (400% growth, 85% retention, 11 years) and flagged high-risk claims (AI chat platform) for verification/rewriting.
  - Extracted the exact AI platform bullet content for verification decisions (models/stack/scope).
  - Read the remainder of `docs/professional_inventory_update.md` and noted where its recommended “evidence policy” conflicts (retention/ratings/growth metrics).
  - Reviewed portfolio + education sections in `index.html` to capture public-facing claims (AI app card, Stuttgart M.Sc., credentials).
- Files created/modified:
  - `task_plan.md` (created)
  - `findings.md` (created)
  - `progress.md` (created)
  - `findings.md` (updated)

### Phase 2: Content Strategy & Structure
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Transitioned to Phase 2 after capturing discovery notes and claim inventory.
  - Wrote positioning options, evidence rules, and a section-by-section update map in `findings.md`.
  - Reviewed `professional-inventory.md` and local LibreChat deployment notes to evaluate how the “AI platform” should be framed for hiring managers.
  - Fetched `jasonholtdigital.com` to confirm what’s publicly visible about Mythic apps (licensed positioning + store/rating schema).

  - `task_plan.md` (updated)
  - `findings.md` (updated)

### Phase 3: Draft Copy (Truth-Checked)
