# Content & Focus Analysis: Frontend Developer Focus

## Current State (Root index.html)

**Primary Focus:** Front End Lead & Learning Product Specialist
**Tagline:** "Front End Lead with 11 years of learning product experience. Specializing in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and educational UX."
**Core Identity:**

- **Dual Expert:** Combines technical engineering (Frontend) with domain expertise (Education/Learning Products).
- **Seniority:** Emphasizes "11 years experience" and "Lead" roles.
- **Tech Stack:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- **Location:** Frankfurt, Germany (US Citizen).

## Prototype Goal: Frontend Focus

To shift the prototype from "General/Mobile Developer" to "Frontend & Learning Product Specialist", we will adopt the following content strategy:

### 1. Hero Section Refinement

- **Headline:** Shift from generic "Independent Developer" to **"Front End Developer & Learning Product Specialist"**.
- **Subheadline:** Highlight specific stack (React/Next.js) + Unique Value Prop (Educational UX).
- **Visuals:** The "Code Snippet" in the hero should display a React Component or Next.js Page structure instead of a generic Class or Flutter code.

### 2. Project Showcase Strategy

We will feature 3 key projects that demonstrate Frontend + Full Stack Web capabilities:

1. **Portfolio & Booking Platform** (Next.js)
    - *Why:* Demonstrates modern React framework mastery, custom logic, and production-grade web dev.
2. **Private AI Chat Platform** (Web/Azure)
    - *Why:* Shows ability to build complex, functional web applications with AI integration (RAG, Semantic Search).
3. **Mythic GME 2e** (Cross-Platform/Flutter)
    - *Why:* Demonstrates product lifecycle ownership and ability to ship complex software, even if it's mobile-first (it proves engineering depth).

### 3. Skills & Arsenal

Re-align the skills section to prioritize the Web/Frontend ecosystem:

- **Primary:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (ES6+).
- **Secondary:** Node.js, Firebase, Azure, AI Integration.
- **Differentiators:** UX Design, Accessibility (WCAG), Learning Product Strategy.

### 4. Experience Narrative

Refine the job descriptions to highlight *web and leadership* aspects:

- **Independent Dev:** Focus on "Architecting cross-platform solutions" and "Product Design".
- **Instructional Tech Coach:** Frame as "EdTech Implementation Lead" - led VR/AR labs (web-based XR), managed learning platforms.
- **CS Teacher:** Emphasize "Web Design Curriculum Authoring" and "Game Design" (interactive logic).

## Missing Elements to Add

- **Education & Certifications:** The original site has a strong section for this (Masters in progress, Awards). We should add a "Credentials" section to the prototype to match this professional depth.
- **"Impact" Metrics:** The original site uses an "Impact" section. We should ensure the Experience section clearly calls out the metrics (e.g., "$200k Grants", "4.8/5 Rating").
