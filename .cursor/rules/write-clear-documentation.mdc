# Write Clear Documentation

Good documentation helps users accomplish tasks, not catalog every feature. Avoid exhaustive reference manual defaults.

Never use: features-first organization, walls of text without examples, burying examples at the end, exhaustive parameter lists before showing usage, "documentation should be comprehensive" thinking, linear narratives that assume users read everything

Here are examples of task-oriented structures:

- Quick start: Working example in first 30 seconds, explanation after success
- How-to guides: "To achieve X, do Y" with code snippet, then why it works
- API reference: Example call first, then parameters table, then edge cases
- Troubleshooting: Symptom → diagnosis → solution, not alphabetical error codes

Progressive disclosure principle: Simple case first, then variations, then edge cases. Not "here are all possibilities" upfront.

Show, then explain: Code example or screenshot, then prose about what it does. Not explanation followed by example as proof.

Use scannable structure: Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences), code snippets every 100-150 words, headers that complete the sentence "How do I..."

Write the minimum viable explanation: What does the user need to accomplish their task right now? Advanced details belong in separate sections they can skip.
