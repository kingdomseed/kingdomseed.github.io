# Use Purposeful Layout

Layout creates visual hierarchy and guides attention. Avoid symmetric, centered-everything defaults.

Never use: every element centered, equal-sized sections, 50/50 splits, uniform card grids, no white space strategy, elements touching edges

Here are examples of purposeful layout approaches:

- Dominant hero: One large element (60-70% viewport) + smaller supporting elements asymmetrically placed
- Editorial: Wide margins (15-20% each side), generous line height, intentional paragraph breaks
- Magazine: Multi-column with varying widths (2:1 ratio, not 1:1), content breaking across columns
- Dashboard: Information density zones - critical data large/sparse, secondary data compact/grouped

Asymmetry principle: 60/40 splits are more interesting than 50/50. Left-heavy or right-heavy, not balanced.

Use white space decisively: Dense clusters separated by generous gaps (3x+ spacing between sections vs within). White space = emphasis.

Create clear visual hierarchy through size dominance: Primary content 3x+ larger than secondary, not 1.5x larger.
