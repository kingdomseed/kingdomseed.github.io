# Use Distrinctive Color

Color palettes instantly communicate design intent. Avoid safe, middle-ground choices.

Never use: Tailwind's purple/blue defaults (#6366f1, #3b82f6), pastel-everything palettes, equal-weight rainbow schemes, generic purple-to-blue gradients

Here are some examples of distinctive, purposeful palettes:

- Bold/energetic: Deep red dominant + electric yellow accent, or saturated orange + cyan
- Professional/trust: Navy + gold, or forest green + cream
- Creative/modern: Ochre + slate, or burgundy + sage
- Technical/precise: Charcoal + neon green, or deep blue + orange

Dominance principle: 70% one color, 20% supporting, 10% accent. One color should clearly own the palette.

Use saturation extremes: Fully saturated primaries OR deeply muted tones, not safety middle-ground. Context drives choice: financial/serious = muted, creative/energetic = bold.

Pick one dominant color, commit to it throughout. Use accent color sparingly for emphasis only.
